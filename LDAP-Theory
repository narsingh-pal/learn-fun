Common applications of LDAP based directories

  LDAP operations include entry creation, modification, deletion and search. 
  As a general rule, LDAP directories are optimized for read and search operations, at the cost of write performance. 
  Data, which will be modified often, therefore better suits in a relational database, which offers better support for transactions and referential integrity as well. Directories are rather used if comparatively stable data has to be provided centrally.
  Common examples are network resources (printers, services) and user data (including credentials and rights for the resources). 
  As a notable feature, many directory products offer replicas, which permit better access times and higher availability especially in geographically dispersed organizations. 
  Not for nothing, the most common LDAP application is the enterprise phone book. 
  That even Microsoft Outlook may be an LDAP client in this case - most average users probably don't know.
